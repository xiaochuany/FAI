## Erdos-Renyi random graphs

Given $n$ nodes, connect any pair of nodes with probability $p$, independently with all other pairs. The induced random graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ is called Erdos-Renyi random graph, denoted by $G(n,p)$. 

```{r}
install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph)
```

We simulate these gaphs wit R package igraph. 

```{r}
g<-erdos.renyi.game(25, 0.1)
plot(g)
```
## Cards

Let's generate a deck of cards. 

```{r}
cards <-c(2:10, "J","Q","K")
suits <- c("♠", "♥", "♦", "♣")
deck <- paste0(rep(cards,length(suits)),rep(suits,each=length(cards)))
sample(deck)
```
